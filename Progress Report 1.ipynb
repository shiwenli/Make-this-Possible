    "In this project, we will briefly introduce a multi-level Bayesian model for discrete data, especially text corpora, latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA). This model is applied to describle the statistical relationships of large collections of discrete data. Along with this model, the relative inference techniques will be provided. But exact inference may be intractable so that approximate inference algorithms can be used for parameter estimation. For example, an empirical Bayesian method for parameter estimation will be presented via a variational EM procedure. Apart from this, to deal with the problem of sparsity of many document corpora, the standard method is to smooth the parameters by assigning positive probabilities to every item. \n",
    "\n",
    "Based on these methods, we will write code to implement the algorithm on simulated data and real dataset. This model can be utilized in many domains, such as document modeling, document classification, and collaborative filtering. Also, we will try to optimize the algorithm and code according to the performance on the above data, such as acceleration, vectorization and so on. At last, we will discuss the effects, advantages and disadvantages of this model."
